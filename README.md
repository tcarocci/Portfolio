<strong>Tyler Alberts Portfolio</strong>

Welcome to my portfolio! The goal for the portfolio was for it to be built from scratch and using HTML and CSS to style the webpage. Targets for this portfolio were to provide a picture, links on portfolio working correctly by launching to the corresponding web pages. Ensure that the portfolio can open on all devices/adapts to viewports. 

This project was a wild one and one I cannot wait to update and make this portfolio 10x better through this journey of coding. I ran into a lot of roadblocks, but I did not give up on the continuous theory crafting with my code and also debugging with Chrome. Throwing everything I have learned in the 8 days of the bootcamp, I felt great finishing this one and making myself familiar with how to debug. I appreciated the wake-up call regarding the mobile side of things when it comes to coding. Note to self and others: Start with the mobile viewpoint when you create your page!!
